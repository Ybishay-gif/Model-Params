# CURRENT_STATE.md

## Snapshot (as of 2026-03-06)
- Project: `planning-app-mvp`
- Runtime: Node.js + TypeScript + Express
- Data backend: BigQuery dataset `planning_app`
- Test mutable dataset provisioned: `planning_app_dev` (cloned snapshot from `planning_app`)
- App dataset split support: writable objects use `BQ_DATASET`; analytics reads can be overridden via `BQ_ANALYTICS_DATASET`
- UI: Static app served from `public/` by `src/server.ts`
- API base path: `/api`
- Health endpoint: `/health`
- Local default port: `8080`
- API route structure: modularized under `src/routes/api/*` and composed via `src/routes/plans.ts`
- Shared backend activity-scope mapping lives in `src/services/shared/activityScope.ts` and is used across analytics/targets
- Shared backend ROE/COR SQL formula helpers live in `src/services/shared/kpiSql.ts` and are reused across analytics/targets
- Frontend formatting/date helpers are modularized in `public/modules/format.js` and imported by `public/main.js`
- Design system source of truth is `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` and is required for all new UI work
- Workstream context convention is active under `docs/workstreams/` for task-specific continuity across chats
- CI workflow exists at `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and runs install + type-check + build

## Implemented Capabilities
- Auth flows:
  - Admin code login
  - User password setup/login
  - Session token validation (`x-session-token`)
- Planning flows:
  - Create/list/get plans
  - Clone plan (copies plan parameters/settings + strategy config and decisions into a new draft plan)
  - Upsert plan parameters
  - Append decisions
  - Create/list run data and results retrieval
  - Plan-context defaults persisted per plan (`plan_context_config`) for:
    - performance date range
    - price exploration date range
    - `qbcClicks`
    - `qbcLeadsCalls`
  - Selected plan acts as master context for analytics date defaults
  - Targets default date range is fixed in UI logic to last 90 days (not configurable)
  - Plan Outcome tab under Plan:
    - grouped rows by Tier + recommended testing point (0% excluded)
    - grouped state/channel lists per outcome row
    - expected clicks/binds/CPC/CPB with uplift indicators
- Analytics endpoints:
  - State segment performance
  - Price exploration
  - Plan merged analysis
  - Strategy analysis
  - Plans comparison (frontend tab, built from strategy-analysis endpoint across plans/scopes)
- Admin utilities:
  - User management
  - Targets APIs
  - Change log APIs

## Data Wiring Status
- Raw source table is referenced via normalized views.
- Primary source views expected from `sql/source_views.sql`:
  - `v_cross_tactic_raw`
  - `v_performance_state_channel`
  - `v_bid_exploration_curve`
- Additional analytics SQL assets exist under `sql/` and should be validated per environment.
- Targets performance can use pre-aggregated table `targets_perf_daily` when present; backend auto-detects and falls back to raw query if absent.
- Targets API supports plan scoping by `planId`; if `planning_app.targets.plan_id` exists, list/create/update can be isolated per selected plan.
- ROE/COR consistency policy is active:
  - calculations must follow global filter scope
  - calculations must use scope-appropriate QBC from selected plan context (`qbcClicks` or `qbcLeadsCalls`)
  - KPI endpoints that compute ROE/COR enforce `qbc` as a required query param (no silent backend fallback)
- Global-filter consistency policy is active for all analytics metrics:
  - all KPI/rollup calculations must respect `activityLeadType`
  - cross-screen comparisons require aligned segment/channel scope
- Table-design consistency policy is active:
  - analytics/data tables should keep the same shared layout and visual structure across screens
  - avoid one-off table style overrides that diverge from the standard table system
- UI delivery process policy is active:
  - prepare reuse plan before non-trivial UI edits
  - when work spans chats, store task context in `docs/workstreams/<topic>.md`
  - run browser validation for changed flows before handoff
  - do not hand off untested UI changes
  - keep `AGENTS.md`, `RUNBOOK.md`, `CURRENT_STATE.md`, and `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` aligned for cross-chat context
- Settings screen policy is active:
  - keep Settings focused on global filters table + default targets file management
  - do not re-introduce date-default/QBC configuration controls under Settings
- Security baseline:
  - `ADMIN_ACCESS_CODE` is required at runtime (no default fallback)
  - optional source override is supported via `BQ_RAW_CROSS_TACTIC_TABLE`
- Environment isolation support:
  - mutable app tables can be cloned from prod to test via `scripts/bq/sync_mutable_tables.ts`
  - after clone, each environment writes to its own `BQ_DATASET`
  - analytics can remain shared by setting `BQ_ANALYTICS_DATASET` to prod dataset
  - mutating Playwright scripts refuse non-local URLs unless `PLAYWRIGHT_ALLOW_REMOTE_MUTATIONS=yes`

## Deployment Status Model
- Local dev: ready via `npm run dev`
- Stable external proxy option: available via `cloudflare-proxy/` using:
  - Named Cloudflared tunnel
  - Stable hostname
  - Cloudflare Worker reverse proxy
- Delivery policy in this repo:
  - Codex should deploy automatically after completing requested changes and passing checks.
  - Deploy confirmation should not be requested each turn unless user explicitly opts out.
  - GitHub should also be updated automatically after deploy without waiting for a separate user prompt.
  - If GitHub push/PR automation is blocked by missing auth or tooling, Codex should attempt to install/configure the tooling first and only then report the blocker.
- Current public Worker endpoint in use:
  - `https://beaconlab.kissterralab.workers.dev/`
  - This is the default deployment/validation URL for future chats in this repo.
  - Proxies to Cloud Run origin via `x-proxy-target` response header
  - Current prod Cloud Run revision: `planning-app-api-00099-2zl` (deployed 2026-03-06)
- Test Cloud Run service (isolated mutable dataset):
  - `https://planning-app-api-dev-758008223769.us-central1.run.app`
  - Runtime env points to:
    - `BQ_DATASET=planning_app_dev`
    - `BQ_ANALYTICS_DATASET=planning_app`
  - This is the required endpoint for all testing/QA/automation runs.
  - Production endpoint must not be used for tests.
  - Current test Cloud Run revision: `planning-app-api-dev-00022-cvx` (deployed 2026-03-06)

## Known Constraints / Risks
- Chat sessions are stateless; context must come from repo docs (`AGENTS.md`, `RUNBOOK.md`, this file).
- Without a maintained `docs/workstreams/` file, task-specific investigation state can still be lost between chats.
- Stability risk if quick tunnels (`trycloudflare.com`) are used instead of named stable tunnel.
- Environment-specific values (domains, tunnel IDs, service account details) are not persisted here by default.
- Local vs deployed drift risk: UI updates in `public/` may not appear on Worker URL until Cloud Run service is redeployed.

## Recent Incident (2026-03-03)
- Issue: Price Exploration `Bids` column was added in repo code but not visible on Worker URL.
- Root cause: Worker pointed at Cloud Run service URL that was serving an older revision, so deployed HTML lagged local files.
- Resolution executed:
  1. Verified Worker target using `x-proxy-target` header.
  2. Deployed Cloud Run service `planning-app-api` from repo source.
  3. Confirmed updated table header on both Cloud Run URL and Worker URL.
- Preventive rule: when UI mismatch is reported, always verify active Worker origin and compare rendered HTML before assuming frontend cache issues.

## Recent Incident (2026-03-04)
- Issue: Worker returned `502 All origins failed` with `https://planning-api.example.com returned 530`.
- Root cause: `cloudflare-proxy/wrangler.jsonc` default placeholder origin was deployed to Worker.
- Resolution executed:
  1. Verified Cloud Run origin health at `https://planning-app-api-758008223769.us-central1.run.app/health`.
  2. Redeployed Worker `beaconlab` with `ORIGIN_BASE=https://planning-app-api-758008223769.us-central1.run.app`.
  3. Confirmed Worker health and proxy headers (`x-proxy-target`, `x-proxy-failover`) on `https://beaconlab.kissterralab.workers.dev/health`.

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Fill environment-specific deployment values:
- Stable hostname
- Worker name/domain
- Tunnel ID and credentials path
2. Verify all required BigQuery SQL objects exist in target project.
3. Add a lightweight release checklist (optional, can be appended to `RUNBOOK.md`).

## Update Protocol
- Update this file whenever architecture, deploy flow, environment shape, or production status changes.
- Keep the "Snapshot" date current on every meaningful operational change.
